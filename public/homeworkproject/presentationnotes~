Slide 1: Title and please connect
Slide 2: Who am I? Why am I here?
Slide 3: Entropy Dissertation
Slide 4: Retrospective on entropy
		Too sensitive
		Works but false positives too
		Home networks are highly unpredictable

Slide 5: Initial task and goals
		Trends
		Network health
		Can we determine if something is up?
Slide 6: Researching metrics
		7 day period from lodge household
		Graphs for
			Bytes, Packets..
		for a 24 hour period
		Looked at network as a whole and individual IP's
Slide 7: Metrics Graph
		Explain standard deviations etc

Slide 8: Findings
		Sadly, not much
		As humans we can spot peaks and troughs and infer what may have happened
		But there were no clear trends across multiple days/IPs
		And we need clear trends to be able to "teach" the computer

Slide 9: Moving on..
		Normalize the data
		Try and find shapes
		A busy day and a quiet day will have widely different magnitudes
		but what if they have the same "shape"
		That's a trend right?
		Feasible a computer can learn a shape
		We can monitor deviations from a shape etc etc
Slide 10: 7 day graph
Slide 11: Monday
Slide 12: Tuesday
Slide 13: User slide
Slide 14: User slide
Slide 15: Progress to date
		Patterns are still visible
		Placing this data next to values of magnitude to determine how much of a blip from the normal trend a blip really is
Slide 16: 
		Thinking about how we can present this to the user so it means something
		Holy Grail: Mapping unidentified traffic data to a user
		Opens up a world of possibilities:

Slide 17: The problem is..
		There is no easy way for us to get this data off the router and onto a web dashboard realtime
		We could create a client-side JS interface
			but it'd be really chunky
			would probably have to modify it a lot
			a lot of control from just JS (read: security)
			couldn't connect to the dashboard remotely
		We could have a client-side Java applet
			it'd work for creating individual applications
			lots of web applications would be a lot of redundancy
			Java applets are just a pain
			and most importantly, all the fantastic visualization libraries and interfaces available today are in JS/HTML5

Slide 18: It has to be server-side
		But also..I wanted it to be
			Easy for anyone to quickly create a new web application
			Lightweight
			Loosely coupled
			Fast!
