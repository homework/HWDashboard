Homebase represents a simple mockup of the base architecture in discussion. It will just implement users 
and the ability to selectively push requests up and downstream to users. It's purpose is to ensure any 
interaction with web users can be achieved with ease through a decoupled interface that does not 
discriminate its upstream source.

Goal:
HWDB-RPC <--> Homebase <--> Node <--> Client

Step 1: Create a suitable Node.JS, Socket.IO and Express.JS for pushing downstream through REST
TestHarness <-REST-> Node <--> Client

Step 2: Create JScript RPC interface to grab data from HWDB and push it downstream to clients (through calls in Node)
HWDB-RPC <--> JScriptRPC <--> Node <--> Client

Step 3: Create a Homebase architecture for notifications to be pushed on a user basis and enable interaction between users
Homebase <-REST-> Node <--> Client

Step 4: Have Homebase subscribe to HWDB and selectively push data downstream
HWDB-RPC <--> JScriptRPC <--> Homebase <--> Node <--> Client
